# Smart grid
## Overview

This is a project to **accurately predict** load usage in the United States by studying **previous** year's data and predicting **future** trends in energy usage demands.

## Objectives
We are studying the energy usage data for in the United states to determine future energy usage.
We are specifically interested in observing the **trends** between the years `2013` and `2016`.

By observing the trends in data demands in these `3` years, we are trying to **generate** an **optimal** algorithm to predict the energy usage for the year `2017`.

We are trying to design an algorithm which meets our energy demands when considered for a **medium term forecasting model**.
