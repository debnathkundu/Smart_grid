# Observations

At first, we examine the following scatter plots:-

**1.** **Plot of Energy Consumption vs GDP**

**2.** **Plot of Energy Consumption vs Population Density**

Now if we do **Linear regression** using `Energy Consumption` as **dependent** variable and `Population density` and `GDP` as **independent** variables, we get the following results:-

Here we see the **correlation coefficient** is **0.4604** which is bad and the **root mean squared error** is very high which suggests that for the next attempt we should go for a different set of factors or that the factors considered do not really affect the energy consumption.
